    <h1 style="color: red;">What is Biotech</h1>
    <p>Biotechnology (biotech) is the science of using living organisms, cells, or biological systems to develop products and technologies for various industries, including healthcare, agriculture, and environmental management. It integrates principles from biology, genetics, chemistry, and engineering to address complex challenges. At its core, biotech focuses on harnessing natureâ€™s processes to improve human life and the environment.

        In healthcare, biotech has revolutionized medicine by enabling the development of innovative treatments, vaccines, and diagnostic tools. Genetic engineering allows for personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to individual genetic profiles, and gene therapies can target specific diseases at the molecular level. Biotech also plays a crucial role in the production of biologic drugs, such as insulin and monoclonal antibodies, that are critical for managing chronic diseases and cancers.
        
        In agriculture, biotech supports the creation of genetically modified (GM) crops that are resistant to pests, diseases, and harsh environmental conditions, helping to address global food security. Environmental biotech includes bioremediation, which uses organisms to clean up pollutants, and the production of biofuels as renewable energy sources.
        
        Overall, biotechnology has the potential to transform industries, offering sustainable solutions and contributing to scientific advancements that can improve the quality of life globally.</p>
